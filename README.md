# Raid: Shadow Legends

All assets are based on v4.10 (v.237)


This repo lets you link to static resources based on IDs rather than hero names. That way embedding hero image assets will always work and there's no more guessing what the filename of a specific avatar may be.

Avatar IDs are referenced inside `hero_types.json`.
